# Website-Template
A Template to building a basic website. See Readme

The template is a centered site making it mobile friendly. 

Excluded is a footer, which can be done very easily. 

The whole point of this is to provide a easy solution for basic HTML sites. 

You can use two colors for the sides as the site is centered. 

Original Code/idea comes from [here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_center_website.asp)

# How to use
