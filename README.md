# Website-Template
A Template to building a basic website. See Readme

The template is a centered site making it mobile friendly. 

Excluded is a footer, which can be done very easily. 

The whole point of this is to provide a easy solution for basic HTML sites. 

You can use two colors for the sides as the site is centered. 

Original Code/idea comes from [here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_center_website.asp)

# How to use

~ For Redistribution use you need to include the license file ~

This requires a fork to use, after forking you can customize and use it as you need. 

To use you just need to customize it! 

Commented instructions on what to change is in the CSS file.

Do **NOT** change anything else. This will corrupt the template.

You can keep the same colors or change them, just do not edit any other parts. It will make it not work right otherwise. 

You can use 1 color on body background and content background to make a 1-color site. 

I use this many times because its the best way to center a website. This is great for info sites portfolios and small businesses.
